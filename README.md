### Redirect WebView
Shows an application redirecting WebView to a specific URL. Contains 3 URLs,
- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" Loads in WebView successfully, as should
- "https://www.google.com" Loads in web browser since it does not contain wikipedia, as should
- "https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/05/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/" Loads in WebView, but should not. This happens because the check the WebView Example app does is incorrect. (It checks for URLs containing wikipedia)

### Starting an unexported service from an other app by abusing broadcast receiver
In this attack, even though the service is not exported, it can be started by a broadcast receiver. This receiver is not protected, making it possible for a malicious app to start the service by sending the required attack.

#### Target: insecure-apps/InsecureServiceApp
The target that has the protected service and unprotected receiver.

#### Attack: basic-attacks/StartUnexportedService
The attack that sends the intent to trigger the reciever. 

### Acquiring a dangerous-level custom permssion 
This attack showcases getting a malicious application acquiring a target's dangerous-level custom permission without prompting the userâ€”the only requirement being that the malevolent app is installed before the victim. This attack only works on android versions before Kitkat.

Important to note that the apps should be signed with a different signature to test this attack properly. This is because the scenario assumed is that the attacker cannot sign the app with the same signature. If he could, the attack would work on newer versions of Android as well as it would not be a problem for the Android system.

#### Target: insecure-apps/ContentDemo
An application that protects its content provider with a dangerous-level custom permission.

#### Attack: basic-attacks/DontentDemoAccess
An application that declares a normal-level custom permission with the same name as the desired target.
